**Machine Learning Model for**

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model that performs [briefly describe the task, e.g., classification, regression, clustering, etc.] on the [name or description of dataset]. The model is designed to [describe the goal of your model, e.g., predict house prices, classify images, etc.].

**Description**

This repository provides a complete machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and testing. It demonstrates the use of [mention key libraries used, e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.] to build and evaluate the model.
The model was trained on the [describe dataset, e.g., "Iris dataset," "custom dataset," etc.] and aims to [objective of your model, e.g., predict the category, estimate a numerical value, etc.].

**Getting Started**
To get started with this repository, you need to have Python 3.x installed. Follow the steps below to set up the environment and run the code.

**INSTALLATION**

**1. Install Dependencies**

You can install the required Python libraries by using pip and the provided requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, you can install dependencies manually using:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

(Include any other libraries used in your project)
**Usage**
**1. Data Preprocessing**

The preprocessing script handles [briefly describe what it does, e.g., "cleaning missing data, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features"].

python preprocess.py

**2. Model Training**

After preprocessing, you can train the model by running:

python train_model.py

**3. Model Evaluation**

Once trained, the model can be evaluated using:

python evaluate_model.py

**4. Make Predictions**

To make predictions on new data:

python predict.py --input data/new_data.csv
